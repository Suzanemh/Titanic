# Titanic
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the analysis of Titanic passenger survival data. The Titanic and Titanic2 data frames provide insights into the survival status of individual passengers, excluding the crew. Notably, the titanic data frame includes real ages for half of the passengers, see this source http://campus.lakeforest.edu/frank/FILES/MLFfiles/Bio150/Titanic/TitanicMETA.pdf
This dataset analysis project is undertaken as part of the 'Introduction to AI' course.
